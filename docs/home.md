## Assignment Information:

This group project focuses on writing a data story for complex datasets. Our definition of a
data story is a series of interlinked visualizations (either static or interactive) with the support
of explanatory text or annotations. We urge all students to focus on creating a highly
visual and/or interactive experience but not using visualization to support text.
