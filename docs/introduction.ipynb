    "The age-old question of whether money can buy happiness continues to spark debate. On one hand, some argue that financial security is a fundamental building block for a fulfilling life.  They believe basic necessities and a decent wage are essential for happiness in today's world.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, some posit that true happiness goes beyond material wealth. They emphasize factors like well-being, longevity, and connection with nature as key ingredients for a happy life.\n",
    "\n",
    "To delve deeper into this complex question, we embark on a data-driven exploration. We'll analyze economic and demographic data from various countries to see if there's a correlation between \"money\" (meaning overall economic well-being) and happiness.  This project aims to shed light on whether financial prosperity paves the way for national and individual happiness.\n",
